************** HANtune 2.1 Release Known issues **************

1. HANcoder models running 10kHz in combination with an active HANtune connection is known to possibly cause unstable behavior.
2. Old HANtune window frames can return under special circumstances.
3. When a DBC file is present in the project, it now always loads upon loading the HANtune project regardless if it was loaded before or not.

*************** HANtune 2.1 Alpha Change Log ***************

In HANtune 2.1 the following features have been added:
1. Service Tool mode, which means HANtune is able to export to an encrypten .shml format of which the entire project is "locked". 
   The end-user can use HANtune in service-tool mode to connect and calibrate only those parameters which are visible on screen.
2. Loading large .a2l files take significantly less time now (under four seconds now opposed to ~2 minutes)
3. Enhanced Calibration Management: The management of calibrations is now more intuitive because a "working parameter set" is used 
   to reflect the current set of parameters. Also more convenient names are used for the calibration features.
4. "Resize and Move mode" now toggles on a short-tap on the Ctrl key.
5. Usability enhancements, such as: "add tab" is used for the tab context menu, "resize and move mode" has been moved to the right-mouse 
   click context menu of empty tab space, viewers and editors, and much more.
6. DBC file usage has been further improved with more checks and bug-fixes.
7. Datalogging with CAN-only is possible now. It also works alongside an XCP on CAN connection.
8. HANtune now warns the user when the XCP on CAN's transmission and reception ID's are used in one of the loaded CAN DBC files to prevent possible conflicts on the CAN bus.

8. Clicking "Open project" while connected will first disconnect and then ask for confirmation to proceed


*************** HANtune 2.0 Release Change Log ***************

Opposed to the 1.1 release some significant new features have been added. 
DBC file support has been added to enable HANtune to be used as a generic CAN-dashboard.
Also the GUI has been thoroughly revised to enhance the look and feel of HANtune.
No additional features are added after the 2.0 beta release.
For full list of changes, please refer to the 2.0 Alpha and 2.0 Beta change logs.

*************** HANtune 2.0 Release Known issues ***************

1.  Loading large .a2l file could take a while (10mb file ~2 min)
2.  At the ASAP2 Elements side tab, right mouse clicking a signal will show the context menu which only contains the Multiviewers. Thereafter it works like it should.
3.  When using XCP on CAN in combination with other nodes on the bus (e.g. also communicating using a DBC file) there's currently no safeguard to warn for overlapping CAN-ID's between the DBC file and XCP's transmission and reception ID.
4.  Importing an existing project into the current project leads to problems when they contain similarly named files
5.  ButtonEditor and RadioButtonEditor: large numbers can push window elements out of sight
6.  Clicking "Open project" while connected will first disconnect and then ask for confirmation to proceed
7.  After loading a project the (first time) right mouse button context menu of the ASAP2 tree only shows the uption of the multi-editor and multi-viewers
8.  ScopeViewer: adding a new signal disables the auto-scale function
9.  HANtune allows the use of double datatype in signals and parameters on CAN in newly defined DAQlists, causing the connection to be terminated (double doesn't fit into an XCP on CAN message)
10. Bar Viewer: modify display range, the upper limit can't be modified using the arrow buttons
12. Button Editor and RadioButtonEditor: may hide the toggled value after defining a new limit (only when multiple parameters are added to the same viewer)
13. Button Editor and RadioButtonEditor: no range/limit check implemented yet
14. Some HANtune windows are not vertically resizable while the mouse pointer indicates it is possible
15. Presentation of numbers still have to be improved: scientific and decimal presentation
16. GaugeViewer: while scaling the gauge the indicators (stripes) sometimes do not correspond to a whole number




*************** HANtune 2.0 Beta Change Log ***************

	This Beta release contains a lot of bug fixes opposed to the Alpha. DBC file support has been extensively tested, as well as tables.

2.	ASAP2 files in the sidepanel can be sorted by subsystem as they are defined in MATLAB Simulink.
3.	New search/filter function in the sidepanel.
4.	DAQ lists can now be added/removed/renamed/activated from the ASAP2 sidepanel.
5.	New sidepanel to display the contents of the DBC file.
6.	Panels within a sidepanel can be resized vertically or minimized/maximized by clicking the double arrows in the top.
--> Drag 'n Drop functionality:
7.  Drag a signal/parameter from the sidepanel and drop it on an empty space in the layout to add a new viewer/editor.
8.	Drag a signal/parameter from the sidepanel and drop it on an existing viewer/editor to add the signal/parameter.

9. The order of signals/paramters in a viewer/editor can now be rearranged through a context menu.
10. Signals/paramters can now be directly removed from a viewer/editor through a context menu.
11. Layouts can be opened independently from ASAP2 files.

--> Default frames for viewers/editors have been replaced:
13.	A titled border, lineborder or no border can be used.
14.	The title used for the border can be editted.
15.	Viewers/editors that can handle multiple signals/parameters have a 1px line border by default.
16.	Viewers/editors that can handle only a single signal/parameter have no border by default.

--> Viewers/editors can now only be moved/resized when HANtune is in "Resize and move" mode. This mode can be entered by either:
17.	Right clicking an empty space in the layout.
18.	Holding the left control key.

19.	Added a new viewer: TextViewer
20. Added a new viewer: LedViewer. This viewer is similair to the BooleanViewer but can handle multiple ranges/colors.
21.	Enhanced logging performance at high speed (1kHz)
22.	Quartz font is back for the digitalViewer
23.	Added a state to the editors: grey, for not active (when it is not part of an active DAQlist) Note: orange still exists, meaning the value could potentially be out of sync with the targets value.
24. Bugfix: HANtune will now automatically show the "Save as" dialog on first save.
25. ScopeViewer background color can now be inverted. This is required for a good visibility on beamers.
26. The connectionDialog has been revised.
27. Fixed an issue with leading zero in the binary representation for the digitalViewer

34. Improved table editor integrity with better input validity checks.
35. The table editor can now also turn orange when it's not in sync with the target.
36.	It is now possible to move windows using the arrow keys. (in resize and move mode)
37. The frequency indicator in the ASAP2 panel now shows the frequency correct at all times
38. Enhanced the correctness of the busload indication.
39. The Scopeviewer can now handle all combinations of signals.

*************** HANtune 2.0 Alpha Known issues ***************
1.	Actively modifying DAQlist may cause HANtune to stall.

1. High frequency logging: missing datapoints. Sometimes a datapoint is missed showing N/A in the logfile.
2. Ethernet on E407: HANtune doesn't force the Ethernet connection to stay open while using a Laptop which goes into low power mode. This can cause a loss of connection when the user isn't using the laptop for a while. User gets a warning with an advise about this problem.
3. Slow ECU cycle time in combination with a high prescaler setting can cause a time-out. Currently HANtune warns the user when this can happen. In the future release the time-out will be set more dynamically.

*************** HANtune 1.1 Alpha 3 Change Log ***************
1. Added Licencing
2. Added an error logger mechanism to improve problem solving
3. HANtune now warns the user when the double datatype is about to be used with CAN as transport layer  (physical restriction)
