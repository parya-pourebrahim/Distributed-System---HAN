<font color="#000099" size="+3">File Logger Signal</font><br>
<p>Block to configure the signal to be logged by the File Logger module.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>The 'File Logger Signal' block configures the input signal of the block to be logged by the File Logger 
Module. This means that the value of the input signal will be sampled by the File Logger Module
and written to the log-file on the SD-card.
</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Remarks</b></font></p>

<ul>
    <li>The File Logger Close block must be present and called explicitly to stop logging, otherwise no
    file will be written to the SD-card. Ideally, this block is called during software shutdown for example
    when the ignition signal goes low in automotive applications. An external trigger can also be used such
    as a button press event or CAN message reception.
</ul>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<dl>
<dt><b>Signal Name</b>
    <dd>This name will be used in the first line of the log file, the first row of the column holding the data
	belonging to the signal. 'enter name' is the default and is used to check if a name has been added, an error
	during the build process will occur when no name has been entered, also when the field has been left blank.
<dt><b>Signal Data Type</b>
    <dd>Specify the data type of the blocks input signal. It is strongly recommended not to use the floating
	point data types: single or double. It is better to rescale the data so it fits in an integer.
<dt><b>Define ALL column numbers manually</b>
    <dd>When this box is not ticked the Simulink model will be scanned and the signals will be added in the order
	in which Simulink finds the File Logger Signal blocks, this can seem random. 
	When the checkbox is ticked an extra field will appear which gives control over the column position of the 
	signals in the log file. If this box is ticked in any of the File Logger Signal blocks it has to be done in ALL 
	File Logger Signal blocks!
<dt><b>Column number</b>
    <dd>This is an index that basically specifies in what column this signal will appear in the
    actual log-file. This parameter can have a value of 1,2,3.... The user has to make sure the numbers are 
	consecutive and there are no gaps i.e.: 1,2,4,5 is <b>not</b> allowed and will cause an error during the build procedure.
	The first column in the log-file is always the timestamp. If the Signal column number is 1, then the block's input 
	signal value will be logged into the first column next to the timestamp.
