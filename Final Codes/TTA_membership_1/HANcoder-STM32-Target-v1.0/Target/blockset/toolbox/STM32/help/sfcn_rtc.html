<font color="#000099" size="+3">Real-time clock</font><br>
<p>Keeps track of the time and date.</p>

<p><font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Description</b></font></p>

<p>The Real-time clock can keep track of the time and the date. The correct time and date needs to be set first with the 'Set Real-time clock block'. 
Once this is done the time and date can be retrieved with the 'Get Real-time clock' block. The Real-time clock will keep track of the time and date 
when the Vbat pin is connected to power. On the E407 a 3V battery can be connected to the 3V_BAT connecter (next to the USB connectors) to keep the 
clock alive. The clock will be updated every second.</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Inputs and outputs</b></font><br>

<p>All inputs and outputs are in unsigned 8-bit integers, uint8.<br>
The number of years is counted from 2000, so 2017 is represented by the number 17.<br>
The time format is 24h so 11PM is represented as 23</p>

<font color="#000099" size="+1"><b>Parameters</b></font><br>

<dt><b>Sample time</b>
  <dd>Sample time of the block. The Sample time (in seconds) defines
the rate at which the block is visited by the real-time scheduler of
the target. The value of the Sample time has to be an integer multiple
of the base sample time of the model.
