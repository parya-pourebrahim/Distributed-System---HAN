## Readme HANcoder models for older Matlab versions
The models in this zip-file are template models for Matlab versions from 2009b until 2013a.

If you want to use Matlab 2013b or newer please use the .slx files. 
Because of changes in the way Matlab builds libraries the .mdl models use a different HANcoder 
library than the .slx files. This means that the models are not interchangeble, meaning a 
HANcoder model made in 2016a cannot be opened in 2013a. Not even when the 'Export to previous 
version' function is used!
